Use of Microchip Copyrighted Material
Microchip documentation (including but not limited to data sheets, manuals, etc.), images, website, and other original creations are valuable assets protected by copyright law. Microchip aims to protect these assets while encouraging the broad dissemination of product literature and related information in order to reach the widest market for Microchip products. To that end, we often consider requests by customers, distributors, and other parties to reproduce, translate, and/or reprint our copyrighted material in a book, CD, magazine, or other reference material to be sold or distributed on the open market. When we approve such requests, Microchip still owns all rights to the copyrighted material including any translations of such material.

If you would like to reproduce, translate, and/or reprint Microchip copyrighted material for commercial purposes you must request Microchip’s written permission by following the 3-step process described below. Microchip’s written permission is not required for personal use or educational (non-profit) use of copyrighted material.

Personal Use of Copyrighted Material: If you use Microchip copyrighted material solely for your personal use you do not need Microchip’s written permission to use such material. However, distribution or reproduction of such materials and images to others (including posting on a website) does require Microchip’s written permission.

Educational and Non-Profit Use of Copyrighted Material: If you use Microchip copyrighted material solely for educational (non-profit) purposes falling under the “fair use” exception of the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976 then you do not need Microchip’s written permission. For example, Microchip’s permission is not required when using copyrighted material in: (1) an academic report, thesis, or dissertation; (2) classroom handouts or textbook; or (3) a presentation or article that is solely educational in nature (e.g., technical article published in a magazine). Please note that offering Microchip copyrighted material at a trade show or industry conference for the purpose of promoting product sales does require Microchip’s permission.
